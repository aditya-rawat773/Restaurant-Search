If you want a taste of the\nlatter, consider ordering the Emily, which is topped with mozzarella,\npistachios, truffled sottocenere cheese, and honey. The menu includes salads\nand a handful of starters, as well as a burger that some meat connoisseurs\nconsider to be among the best in the city."

Too juicy for its own good and downright addicting. Also try the\nColony pizza. Many others looked like worthy competitors, but the Colony\nreally found its way to my heart. When you start with a great crust, top it\nwith top notch cheese and sauce, you've got a winner. But, if you go a step\nfurther and add the salty from the pepperoni, the sweet from the honey, and\nthe spicy from the chili oil.... your mouth is confused and happy at the same\ntime."
